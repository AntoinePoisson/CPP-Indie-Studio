# CPP-Studio
## Purpose:
It's 2nd year project of Epitech.<br/>
The aim of the project is to implement a cross-platform 3D video game with real-world tools.<br/>

Cross-platform build system:<br/>
• Linux: it must generates a Makefile to be able to build the project<br/>
• Windows: it must generates a Visual Studio solution .sln (will be tested with Visual Studio 2019)<br/>

Engine Graphic handled by Irrlicht 1.8.4<br/>
Sounds and musics handled by SFML-audio 2.5<br/>

The game implement is a Bomberman-like game (see below).<br/>
